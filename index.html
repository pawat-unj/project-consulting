    <p>
        I'm Ice, a software-hardware engineer currently part of the Silicon team at ï£¿. Prior to this, I completed my undergraduate degree in <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate/eecs-bs/">EECS at UC Berkeley</a>. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I have extensive experience working on computer-related projects, from simple Command Line tools to complex compute units in Apple Silicon. Additionally, I have over 5 years of teaching experience, most recently working as a head undergraduaute instructor for <a href="https://cs186berkeley.net/fa24/staff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a database class at UC Berkeley</a>.

    <h2 class="typewriter" data-text="How I can help.."></h2>
    <p>I offer project consulting for high school students applying to CS/engineering programs. Whether you're stuck ideating, need technical help building a prototype, or want feedback before showcasing it to colleges, I can provide guidance every step of the way.
      <br>
      <br>
      All projects are tailored around your interests, ensuring not only an enhanced college application but also valuable hands-on experience and practical skills in your chosen field. <strong>While I provide close mentorship and support, the final project will authentically reflect your own efforts and creativity.</strong>      
      <br>
      <br>
      Consulting sessions typically occur weekly and span 3â€“5 months, depending on your project's complexity and your experience level. No prior skills are necessary â€” you'll learn and develop everything you need along the way.
